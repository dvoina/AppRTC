# AppRTC

AppRTC demo application for WebRTC on Android. 
The sources were taken down from Chromium project (20GBytes).
The version here is a stripped down version of it with precompiled native libs and libjingle.

The modifications from the original source are:
* used nv-websocket-client library instead of the original Autobahn in order to support websockets.
* build moved to gradle
